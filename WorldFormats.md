# World Formats
TSL currently has 3 world formats: Schematic, Dynamic Dictionary and Fixed Dictionary.

## Startup Mem vs GC'd Mem
 * Startup Memory is the amount of memory used while starting the server on a machine with 12 GB RAM
   * It's possible the GC may reduce this value on a machine that has more restricted RAM total
 * GC'd Memory is the amount of memory required to run the server after the initial Garbage Collector sweep (10 seconds or so)

## Note
The following tests were done on an arena and entire large world taken from a real server. Values may differ with other worlds and arenas.

## Micro Worlds
A micro world in TSL is the size of an arena.
