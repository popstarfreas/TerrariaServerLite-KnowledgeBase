## How to Download
TSL is currently not finished, which means that it is not even suitable for some of its intended roles. All the commands listed in Drawbacks.md do exist already however.
It can currently be used for:
 * A lobby server (a small place where people can use something like warpplates to go to other dimensions)
 * An items server (a small place with chests with autorefill and the item command)
 * An archive server (a read-only version of a large world that uses about 100 MB of RAM)
 
 If you want to be an early adopter of TSL, you need to contact me in one of the following places:
  * PM on https://dark-gaming.com
  * DM on https://phase.dark-gaming.com
  * If you have me on steam, message there
